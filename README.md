This is a [Next.js] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]. This application uses the free service swAPI.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Please wait until the build is complete, this project uses static site generation so it will take a bit longer. This makes the app faster.

Once the build is complete, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result (Or with the port where the application was started).
